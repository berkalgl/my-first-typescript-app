# My-First-TypeScript-App

-- npm start to run the server

1) tsconfig is a config file of the typescript app that allows you change the compilerOptions, files etc.. in terminal if you write -h (stands for --help) you will see the options of the compiler

2) webpack.config.js is to manage the server options

3) watch key in tsconfig allows that you dont have to compile each time you have saved a file

4)strict true key is a key that shows you which error will occur in runtime  

5) strictNullChecks really eliminate the runtime errors related to null or undefined
